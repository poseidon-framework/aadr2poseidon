# AADR2Poseidon

Here we compile scripts and resources to transform the [Allen Ancient DNA Resource (AADR)](https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/allen-ancient-dna-resource-aadr-downloadable-genotypes-present-day-and-ancient-dna-data) to Poseidon format.

See the respective directories for detailed instructions how to prepare the packages and documentation of the decisions we made when transforming from one format to the other.
