# AADR2Poseidon

Here we collect scripts and resources to transform the [Allen Ancient DNA Resource (AADR)](https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/allen-ancient-dna-resource-aadr-downloadable-genotypes-present-day-and-ancient-dna-data) to Poseidon format.

Readily compiled versions of the AADR in Poseidon packages are available in the aadr-archive [here](https://github.com/poseidon-framework/aadr-archive), so you generally do not have to run the code here.
